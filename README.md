# AutoMute
Quick script that toggles Windows mute on a timer. Great for muting ads!

Note that it _toggles_ the mute state. So to perform a mute and unmute after n seconds, you must start unmuted and vis versa.

# Usage
Run at ```cmd.exe``` shell with  
``` > cscript FILENAME TIME ```  
FILENAME - This script.  
TIME - In seconds. Must be positive. Can be integer or decimal.
